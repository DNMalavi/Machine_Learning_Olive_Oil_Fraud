### <center><b> Hyperspectral imaging, machine learning and chemometrics for authentication of extra virgin olive oil: A comparative approach with FTIR, UV-VIS, Raman, and GC-MS</b></center>

**Extra-virgin olive oil (EVOO)** is highly valued for its premium quality and numerous health benefits, making it a prime target for fraud. Adulteration with cheaper oils compromises quality, deceives consumers, and undermines market trust. Traditional detection techniques, such as Gas Chromatography (GC-MS), are effective but have significant drawbacks: they are destructive, time-consuming, and costly.

**Why Hyperspectral Imaging (HSI)?**
**Hyperspectral imaging (HSI)** combines imaging and spectroscopy to capture detailed spectral information across a wide range of wavelengths. Near-Infrared HSI (NIR-HSI) is particularly advantageous for food authenticity applications, including EVOO fraud detection, as it is:

- Non-destructive
- Time-efficient
- Capable of capturing both spatial and spectral information

By capturing a comprehensive spectral fingerprint at each pixel, NIR-HSI can detect even minor adulteration (Malavi et al., 2023), making it a superior alternative to traditional methods.

**Enhancing Detection with Machine Learning**
The combination of NIR-HSI and machine learning significantly improves detection accuracy and efficiency. Machine learning algorithms analyze the complex spectral datasets generated by NIR-HSI, identifying patterns and anomalies indicative of adulteration. This powerful, data-driven approach offers:

- High detection accuracy
- Efficient processing of large spectral datasets
- Reliable identification of subtle adulteration

Together, NIR-HSI and machine learning provide a cutting-edge, non-destructive solution for safeguarding the authenticity of extra-virgin olive oil, ensuring consumer trust and product integrity.

***Machine Learning Overview**

**Dimensionality Reduction & Clustering:**
- Utilize `Principal Component Analysis (PCA)` to `reduce the complexity of high-dimensional spectral data` while preserving essential variance. `K-Means clustering` is applied for `unsupervised classification` to uncover patterns and potential adulteration in EVOO samples.

**Supervised Classification for Fraud Detection:**
- Leverage machine learning techniques combined with chemometrics to classify pure and adulterated EVOO samples based on spectral data from various analytical techniques. These models help distinguish authentic products from fraudulent ones.
- Techniques include:
    - `Linear Discriminant Analysis (LDA)`: Projects data for maximum class separability.
    - `k-Nearest Neighbors (kNN)`: Classifies samples based on proximity to labeled neighbors.
    - `Support Vector Machines (SVM)`: Finds optimal decision boundaries for robust classification.
    - `Random Forest (RF)`: Uses an ensemble of decision trees to enhance prediction accuracy.
    - `Artificial Neural Networks (ANN)`: Captures complex, non-linear relationships in data for high detection accuracy.

**Adulterant Concentration Prediction:**
- Develop regression models to `accurately predict the concentration of adulterants` in EVOO within the range of 0% to 20%. This capability supports both qualitative and quantitative fraud detection.
- Implemented Regression Models
    - `k-Nearest Neighbors (kNN)`: Predicts adulterant concentration based on the average values of the k-nearest training samples, capturing local data relationships.

    - `Principal Component Regression (PCR)`: Combines PCA for dimensionality reduction and linear regression to handle multicollinearity in spectral data.

    - `Support Vector Machines (SVM)`: Utilizes a regression-based approach (SVR) to capture complex, non-linear relationships between spectral features and adulterant concentrations.

    - `Random Forest (RF)`: An ensemble method using multiple decision trees to improve prediction accuracy and robustness by capturing feature interactions and non-linear relationships.

**Abstract**

Limited information on monitoring adulteration in extra virgin olive oil (EVOO) by hyperspectral imaging (HSI) exists. This work presents a comparative study of chemometrics for the authentication and quantification of adulteration in EVOO with cheaper edible oils using GC-MS, HSI, FTIR, Raman and UV-Vis spectroscopies. The adulteration mixtures were prepared by separately blending safflower oil, corn oil, soybean oil, canola oil, sunflower oil, and sesame oil with authentic EVOO in different concentrations (0â€“20%, m/m). Partial least squares-discriminant analysis (PLS-DA) and PLS regression models were then built for the classification and quantification of adulteration in olive oil, respectively. HSI, FTIR, UV-Vis, Raman, and GC-MS combined with PLS-DA achieved correct classification accuracies of 100%, 99.8%, 99.6%, 96.6%, and 93.7%, respectively, in the discrimination of authentic and adulterated olive oil. The overall PLS regression model using HSI data was the best in predicting the concentration of adulterants in olive oil with a low root mean square error of prediction (RMSEP) of 1.1%, high R2pred (0.97), and high residual predictive deviation (RPD) of 6.0. The findings suggest the potential of HSI technology as a fast and non-destructive technique to control fraud in the olive oil industry.

**Overall Conclusion** 

The project highlights the potential of hyperspectral imaging as a fast and effective method for detecting fraud in olive oil. When combined with chemometrics and machine learning models, this approach consistently outperforms other techniques in distinguishing between pure and adulterated olive oil. Additionally, the models accurately predict the concentration of contaminant oils, achieving a low RMSE on the test set.
